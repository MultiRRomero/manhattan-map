manhattan-map
=============

Page with Google Maps, which renders neighborhoods and subway stops.

Files:
- main.html: Markup lives here. So does CSS. (It's tiny, 
             so it's simply embedded in style attributes.
             No need for an extra file.). Most of this is
             boilerplate.
- main.js:   The meat of the project. Here lies all the
             logic for rendering neighborhoods and subway
             stops.
